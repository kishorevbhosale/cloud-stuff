# Secure IPv6-Only Outbound Architecture for EC2

To meet the company's **security and connectivity requirements** during the migration to Amazon EC2 with **IPv6-only outbound access**, a Solutions Architect must architect a secure, inspectable, and filterable traffic flow.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- ‚úÖ Only **IPv6 outbound** traffic is allowed to the internet.
- ‚úÖ **Inbound IPv6** traffic from the internet is **blocked**.
- ‚úÖ All traffic should be **inspectable and filterable** (e.g., for DLP, IDS/IPS, compliance).

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Design ‚Äì Step-by-Step

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1** | Launch **EC2 instance** in a **private subnet** with **IPv6 address only**, and **no public IPv6 IP** |
| **2** | Create and attach an **Egress-Only Internet Gateway (EIGW)** to your VPC |
| **3** | Update the **route table** to direct all IPv6 traffic (`::/0`) to the **EIGW** |
| **4** | Deploy an **AWS Network Firewall** or a **transparent proxy (e.g., Squid)** for traffic **inspection and filtering** |
| **5** | Configure **Security Groups (SGs)** and **Network ACLs (NACLs)** to **restrict all inbound IPv6 traffic** |
| **6** | Enable **monitoring** using **VPC Flow Logs**, **Amazon CloudWatch**, and/or **Amazon GuardDuty** |

---

## üîê Notes

- **Egress-Only Internet Gateway** is the **IPv6 equivalent** of a NAT Gateway.
- **Private subnets** and **no public IPs** protect EC2 instances from direct inbound access.
- **Security Groups** are **stateful**, while **NACLs** are **stateless** ‚Äî use both for defense-in-depth.
- **AWS Network Firewall** allows you to define **stateless and stateful rule groups** for traffic filtering.
- Consider integrating **AWS WAF** and **Amazon Inspector** for additional security layers.

---

## üß≠ Optional Enhancements

- Use **IAM roles** for EC2 to avoid hardcoding credentials.
- Log and audit access with **AWS CloudTrail**.
- Automatically respond to anomalies using **AWS Config** + **EventBridge** + **Lambda**.

## üìä Monitoring Tools

| Tool              | Purpose                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **VPC Flow Logs** | Track network traffic patterns   |
| **CloudWatch**    | Set alarms and log metrics       |
| **GuardDuty**     | Detect anomalies or threats      |

By following the above steps, you ensure your architecture is secure, compliant, and aligned with best practices for IPv6 connectivity and traffic inspection in AWS.
